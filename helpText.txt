Welcome to my iterative deepening A* peg solitaire solver!
Peg Solitaire is a single-player puzzle that infuriated me the first time I saw it,
and subsequently attempted to solve it for hours. Afterwards, I went home and
wrote a basic brute-force attempt to solve the puzzle, but it didn't work.

The game itself is fairly simple: it's essentially 1-player checkers on a plus-shaped board.
The goal of the player is to remove all of the pegs except one by jumping them over other pegs.
In my visual outputs of the board, 'o' represents a peg in a slot, '.' represents a slot without
a peg, and 'x' represents a square that's not part of the board at all.

Through attempting MANY different heuristic variants, I have finally found a way to solve
the peg solitaire puzzle using A*! Note that even through use of an advanced algorithm this was
quite difficult. The only time I've managed to find a solution using this search took half an hour
to run, using the settings that are currently the default for this program.
You can enable Iterative Deepening from the menu if you want.

Note that while the Iterative Deepening does function, it runs at such a slow pace for this surprisingly
depth-intensive game that it's more practical to simply run the program without it, which is why it defaults 
to disabled.

Note that if you run this program with its default settings, it WILL deterministically solve the peg 
solitaire puzzle within about a half hour.

While running, the program will print out an update board once every PRINT_FREQ expansions.
If a solution is found, that solution will be printed as a set of moves.

Defaults:
Heuristics = PCLNZZ, largestManhattanDistance
Heuristic weights = [0.5, 4]
ITERATIVE_DEEPENING_ENABLED = False
PRINT_FREQ once every thousand expansions, CUTOFF disabled, weights Heuristic and Cost equally.

To run the searcher with its default settings, simply return to the home menu and select (r)un.

Return to menu? y/n
